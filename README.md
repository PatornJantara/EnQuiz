This is a pseudo Thai engineering association test (กว.) application . There are 2 feature, 1. practice mode which provides an correct answer to you immediately after you summit your answer and 2. read test mode which gives you a realistic experience. However I have only 8 subject for now, As follows 4. general subjects, 3 electrical major subjects + 1 elective subject (High voltage engineering). I hope you will contribute this project by helping me collect more subject question for usage of our careermate. Thanks
